## Todolist webapp

A basic app built with [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org).

Uses an API ([this todolist-api project](https://github.com/pomerantsev/todolist-api)) as a backend.

Authenticates the user and stores their authentication token in a cookie.

Here is [the app in all its glory](http://todolist-webfront.herokuapp.com).
